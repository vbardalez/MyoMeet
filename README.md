# MyoMeet

##Goal
The objective of MyoMeet is to help professionals to expand their network. The concept was developed around the common practice of exchanging of business cards during networking events. MyoMeet will allow you to connect with other professionals over the web with a merely handshake. 

##How does it work?
When the two users of the Myo Armband engage in a handshake, the sensors inside the gadgets can recognize the motions, and send requests to add each other on their respective contact list. Both users can later review their list and keep or delete the newly made contacts. 

##Future Iterations
By the end of the hackathon, we were only able to complete the script which allows the Myo Connect application to identify individual Myos and recognize when a handshake occurs. In development still was the web page that is triggered by a Myo syncing to a laptop, which allows users to create/edit their profile to be shared with others. Some features that we wanted to implement: 
1.  A user system where people can edit their profile from any device.
2. Use the Bluetooth on smartphones as a hub to connect Myos together anywhere
3. Connect the profiles to LinkedIn and various academic networking accounts.
